# Refinery: Product Blending

`difflow_refinery` holds refinery models. Its first one is the **product blending pool**. It mixes component streams into finished products (gasoline, jet, ULSD, fuel oil), computes the properties that specs are written on, and reports a signed margin per spec. It uses the nonlinear blending rules refiners use, and it is differentiable in the recipe and in every component property.

```python
from difflow_refinery import BlendComponent, BlendPool

reformate = BlendComponent.from_properties(
    "reformate", SG=0.80, RON=98.0, MON=88.0, RVP_psi=3.5, S_ppm=1.0,
    olefins_vol=1.0, aromatics_vol=65.0)
# ... fcc, alkylate, butane likewise

pool = BlendPool("gasoline")                 # default specs: RON, MON, RVP, S
res = pool([reformate, fcc, alkylate, butane], recipe=[0.35, 0.35, 0.25, 0.05])
res.properties["MON"], res.margins["MON >= 82"]

pool.linear_blend_error(components, recipe)  # nonlinear minus linear-by-volume
pool.backoff(components, recipe, exact=("RVP_psi", "S_ppm"))
pool.spec_violations(components, recipe, temperature=0.05)   # smooth max(-m, 0)
pool.as_block(components)                    # a difflow.planning.Block
```

Like `difflow.planning`, this is a library rather than a set of GUI palette operations. It registers no `difflow.plugins` entry point. A pool is called with a recipe and returns properties and margins, which is not the stream-in/stream-out shape a palette unit has.

Example: `examples/33_refinery_gasoline_blending.ipynb`. Tests: `tests/refinery/test_blending.py`.

## Components: property mode and stream mode

A `BlendComponent` is built one of two ways:

- **`from_properties(name, SG=..., RON=..., ...)`**: measured or unit-reported properties only. This is enough for every *blended* property.
- **`from_stream(name, stream, characterization, **overrides)`**: a difflow stream of pseudocomponent molar flows on a shared `BlendCharacterization`. The composition gives `SG`, sulfur, nitrogen, PNA and a Raoult RVP. Overrides (a reformer's reported RON, say) take precedence. This mode adds:
  - the product **stream**, with an exact mass and volume balance;
  - the properties only composition can give: distillation and cetane index;
  - the Raoult RVP of the blend itself.

One pool takes one mode. Mixing the two raises an error rather than producing a product stream that is missing some components' mass.

**Volume basis.** Volumes are ideal-mixing volumes at 15 °C from `SG` (`rho = SG * 999.10 kg/m^3`). The product volume is the sum of the component volumes, and the product `SG` is the volume average. Both are tested to round-off against the product stream's own composition.

Recipes can be given as `basis="volume_fraction"` (the default), `"volume_flow"`, or `"split"`. A split is the fraction of each component stream's available volume sent to the pool, which is the natural lever when the pool sits in a flowsheet.

## Blending rules

| Property | Key | Rule (default first) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| RON, MON | `RON`, `MON` | Ethyl RT-70 interaction model; or linear by volume | Healy, Maassen & Peterson (1959), Ethyl report RT-70 |
| RVP | `RVP_psi` | RVP^1.25 index by volume; Raoult on the pseudocomponents; or linear | Gary, Handwerk & Kaiser, product blending chapter |
| Sulfur, nitrogen, CCR | `S_ppm`, `N_ppm`, `CCR_wt` | by mass | - |
| Aromatics, olefins, benzene, PNA, smoke point | `*_vol`, `smoke_mm` | by volume | - |
| Flash point | `flash_C` | Hu-Burns index, `log10 BI = -6.1188 + 2414/(T - 42.6)` (K), by volume | Hu & Burns (1970); identical to Wickey-Chittenden in °F |
| Cloud, pour point | `cloud_C`, `pour_C` | `BI = T^n` (K), n = 1/0.05 and 1/0.08 | Hu & Burns (1970) |
| Freeze point, CFPP | `freeze_C`, `CFPP_C` | `BI = T^n`, cloud-type and pour-type exponents | approximation, override with `rules={"freeze_C_exponent": ...}` |
| Viscosity | `viscosity_cSt` | Refutas VBN `14.534 ln ln(nu + 0.8) + 10.975`, by mass | Refutas, as given in Maples (2000) |
| Distillation | `E70_tbp`, `E100_tbp`, `T{10,50,90,95}_d86_C` | from the blend's composition: smoothed TBP, then Riazi-Daubert TBP->D86 | Riazi & Daubert (1986) |
| Cetane index | `cetane_index` | ASTM D4737 (default) or D976 on the blend's density and D86 points; computed, never blended | ASTM D4737, D976 |

Choose rules per property with `BlendPool(rules={"octane": "volume", "RVP_psi": "raoult", "cetane": "d976"})`.

The RT-70 corrections are all *spreads*: covariances and variances across the components of sensitivity, olefins and aromatics. The model therefore reduces exactly to the linear blend when the components agree. The coefficients are the published 75-blend fit (`a1 = 0.03224`, `a2 = 0.00101`, `a3 = 0`, `b1 = 0.04450`, `b2 = 0.00081`, `b3 = -0.0645`, the last on the squared aromatic spread / 1e4), as restated in the gasoline-blending literature. They live in `EthylRT70` and can be refitted. On a reformate/FCC pool the MON correction is several octane numbers, so check them against your own blend data.

The distillation points are on a TBP curve made differentiable by spreading each pseudocomponent with a logistic of `distillation_width` (default 5 K). Each point is then converted to D86 with the Riazi-Daubert correlation, because specs are written on D86. `E70`/`E100` stay on the TBP basis, and the key says so.

## Specs and margins

`BlendSpec(property, op, limit, scale=1.0)`. The margin is `value - limit` for `>=` and `limit - value` for `<=`, divided by `scale`, so **positive means on spec**. `PRODUCT_SPECS` holds illustrative defaults for each product: US regular summer gasoline, Jet A, ULSD S15, and VLSFO RMG 380. Pass your own specs for anything real.

- `spec_margins(components, recipe)` returns the margin vector, smooth in everything. With `weighted=True` it returns `V * margin` instead. A property is intensive, so it is 0/0 at an empty pool. The weighted form is the same constraint wherever `V > 0`, stays finite at zero, and is the form an LP's blending rows take. Use it as the constraint for an optimizer over volume flows.
- `spec_violations(..., temperature=t)` returns `max(-margin, 0)`, or its softplus `t * logaddexp(-margin/t, 0)`. The smooth form is within `t ln 2` of the kink and its derivative at an active spec is exactly `-1/2`. The branchless `max(u,0) + log1p(exp(-|u|))` has the same value and a derivative of zero there; see the CVaR note in `difflow.stochastic`.

## Linear blend error and back-off

`linear_properties` is the planning-LP view: every property linear by volume. `linear_blend_error` is nonlinear minus that view, and it is what a planner's back-off is meant to cover. Pass `exact=("RVP_psi", "S_ppm")` for properties the LP already models with the pool's own rule (the RVP index, sulfur by mass). Their error is then zero. `backoff` turns the error into a per-spec tightening, `max(linear margin - nonlinear margin, 0)`.

The example measures what this means for a gasoline LP:

- without back-off, the LP promises about 50% more margin than any feasible plan, and its recipe is about two MON numbers off spec;
- the back-off depends on the recipe, so one pass is not enough; successive back-off takes about a dozen passes to settle;
- on that pool the converged plan coincides with the best local optimum of the nonlinear problem, but a single-start NLP stops at a worse one. Blending is nonconvex, so neither tool is safe alone.

## Planning hook

`pool.as_block(components)` returns a `difflow.planning.Block`. Its levers are the component volume flows (`<name>_V`), bounded by availability in stream mode. Its outputs are the product `volume`, the spec properties, and `margin:<spec>` for every spec. `jax.jacobian` of the block is the delta-vector set: the volume row is the volume balance, all ones, and the property rows are the blend's sensitivities at the linearisation point.

## Blend characterization

`BlendCharacterization(names, Tb, SG, MW=, Tc=, Pc=, omega=, qualities=)` is the pseudocomponent grid. Molecular weight and critical constants come from Riazi-Daubert (1980), the acentric factor from Edmister, and vapor pressure from Lee-Kesler. Any of them can be overridden per pseudocomponent by passing a vector with NaN where the correlation should be used. That is how a defined component such as n-butane takes its own constants. `qualities` holds the per-pseudocomponent composition vectors (`S_ppm`, `aromatics_vol`, ...), each averaged on its own basis.

This is the minimum a blend pool needs to compute properties from composition. It is not an assay model: there is no TBP fitting and no heavy-end extrapolation. The CDU/VDU work is where those belong.

## Not in scope

- Tank inventory and multi-period scheduling. The pool is steady state, per period.
- Crude blending ahead of the CDU (assay mixing).
- A straight-run octane correlation from PNA. Octane is unit-reported or measured.
