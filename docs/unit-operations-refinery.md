# Refinery Unit Operations

This document covers the `difflow_refinery` plugin. It characterises a crude from its assay and separates it in a crude distillation unit (CDU): a fired heater and an atmospheric column, with side strippers, pumparounds and stripping steam. The products are reported the way a refinery reads them: yields, API gravities and TBP ranges. Finished components are blended into products in a nonlinear blending pool.

## Overview

The `difflow_refinery` plugin provides:

- **Assay characterisation** (`Assay`, `characterize`): a TBP curve plus a gravity, cut into pseudo-components with the standard petroleum correlations. Light ends (C1--C6) are kept as real species.
- **Column thermodynamics** (`ColumnThermo`): vectorised over stages and components.
  - Raoult's law with Lee-Kesler vapour pressures.
  - Ideal-gas-path enthalpies.
  - Stripping steam as a vapour that condenses only as free water in the overhead drum.
- **The atmospheric column** (`CrudeColumn`): an equation-oriented MESH model, with side strippers, pumparounds, bottom and stripper steam, and a total or partial condenser.
- **The furnace** (`Furnace`): solved *with* the column, so an overflash spec sets the coil outlet temperature, as it does in operation.
- **Product properties** (`product_properties`, `products.gaps`): rates, volume and mass yields, SG/API, and TBP 5/10/50/90/95 points. Also the 5--95 gaps between neighbouring cuts.
- **`CrudeUnit`**: the assembly a planner means by "the CDU": assay in, yield table out.
- **`CrudeDistillationUnit`**: the same unit behind difflow's operation protocol, for a `Flowsheet`, JSON and the editor.
- **Product blending** (`BlendPool`, `BlendComponent`): gasoline, jet, ULSD and fuel-oil pools with the nonlinear blending rules, signed spec margins and LP back-off. A library for optimisation and planning, not a palette operation.

Everything is differentiable with `jax`. A product yield, a gravity or a furnace duty has an exact gradient with respect to:

- every spec value;
- the crude rate and preheat temperature;
- the assay data behind the thermodynamics (TBP points, gravity).

The column is solved by damped Newton. Gradients are implicit-function gradients at the converged point, not derivatives taped through the iterations.

## Installation

The plugin ships with difflow and registers itself through the `difflow.plugins` entry point:

```python
import difflow_refinery as dr
```

(refinery-characterisation)=
## Characterising a crude

A crude is too many molecules to list. It is described by its true boiling point (TBP) curve and a gravity, and the curve is cut into narrow boiling ranges, each of which becomes one pseudo-component:

```python
from difflow_refinery import Assay, characterize

assay = Assay(
    tbp_percent=[0, 5, 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 95, 100],
    tbp_T=[t + 273.15 for t in [20, 60, 95, 205, 315, 430, 580, 640, 760]],
    sg=0.86,
    light_ends={"propane": 0.005, "n_butane": 0.01, "n_pentane": 0.015},
)
crude = characterize(assay)          # default cut points, Twu critical properties
crude.names, crude.Tb, crude.sg, crude.volume_fraction
```

- **Interpolation:** the curve is interpolated monotonically (PCHIP).
- **Default cut widths:** 20 K below 400 °C, 40 K to 600 °C, 100 K above that (`DEFAULT_CUT_WIDTHS`).
- **Gravity:** a bulk SG is distributed over the cuts at a constant Watson K. Alternatively, pass `sg_curve=` to give the gravity cut by cut.
- **Critical-property correlations** (`CRITICAL_METHODS`):
  - `"twu"` (the default);
  - `"riazi_daubert_1987"`;
  - `"riazi_daubert_1980"`;
  - `"lee_kesler"`.

  Acentric factors are chosen so that each pseudo-component boils at its own `Tb`.

The cut points fix the number of pseudo-components and, with it, the shape of the column's equations. Keep them fixed when differentiating with respect to the assay.

This is not an assay library. Curated assays are proprietary data; the module characterises the curve the caller brings.

---

(refinery-column)=
## The atmospheric column

An atmospheric crude column is a main column with no reboiler:

- The crude arrives partly vaporised from the furnace and is stripped with steam.
- **Side products** are drawn as liquid from intermediate stages. Each is usually finished in a steam-stripped side stripper, whose vapour returns one stage above the draw.
- **Pumparounds** draw liquid, cool it outside the column and return it higher up. They remove heat part-way up, and so set the internal reflux in each section.

```python
from difflow_refinery import ColumnThermo, column as cc

thermo = ColumnThermo.from_characterization(crude)
params = cc.CrudeColumnParams(
    n_stages=30, feed_stage=27, P_top=1.5e5, P_bottom=1.9e5, P_condenser=1.3e5,
    bottom_steam=..., steam_T=533.15,               # steam in mol/s
    side_products=(cc.SideProduct("kero", 9, 4, steam=...),
                   cc.SideProduct("diesel", 16, 4, steam=...),
                   cc.SideProduct("ago", 22, 3, steam=...)),
    pumparounds=(cc.Pumparound("pa1", 12, 10), cc.Pumparound("pa2", 19, 17)),
    specs=(cc.product_rate("naphtha", ...), cc.product_rate("kero", ...),
           cc.product_rate("diesel", ...), cc.product_rate("ago", ...),
           cc.pumparound_duty("pa1", 15e6), cc.pumparound_delta_t("pa1", 60.0),
           cc.pumparound_duty("pa2", 20e6), cc.pumparound_delta_t("pa2", 60.0)),
)
col = cc.CrudeColumn(params, thermo)
col.degrees_of_freedom()
res = col.solve(feed)                # res.products, res.T, res.condenser_duty, ...
```

### Degrees of freedom and specs

The degrees of freedom follow a simulator's:

| Element | Freedoms |
|---|---|
| Total condenser | 1 (the distillate split) |
| Partial condenser | 2 |
| Each side product | 1 (its draw rate) |
| Each pumparound | 2 (rate and return temperature) |
| `Furnace` | 1 (its coil outlet temperature) |

Close them with specs, exactly as many as there are freedoms (the constructor says how many are missing):

| Spec | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `product_rate(name, value, basis="volume")` | rate of the distillate, a side product, `"residue"` or `"offgas"` |
| `reflux_ratio(value)` | reflux over overhead product, molar |
| `stage_temperature(stage, T)` | a main-column stage temperature (stage 0 is the condenser) |
| `pumparound_rate`, `pumparound_duty`, `pumparound_return_temperature`, `pumparound_delta_t` | the two pumparound freedoms |
| `overflash(value, basis="volume")` | liquid leaving the stage above the flash zone, as a fraction of crude |
| `coil_outlet_temperature(T)`, `furnace_duty(Q)` | the furnace, directly |

Spec values are traceable: the gradient with respect to one is the column's sensitivity to that spec. Rates are in mol/s, kg/s or standard m³/s at 60 °F; `cc.BARREL` converts to barrels.

### Model

MESH holds on every equilibrium stage of the main column and of every stripper, all solved simultaneously (the Naphtali--Sandholm approach). The bubble-point method fails on a feed that boils across 600 K.

- **Unknowns per stage:**
  - the log component liquid flows;
  - the temperature;
  - the log total vapour flow, steam included.
- **Vapour:** the hydrocarbon vapour follows from Raoult's law. The water vapour is what is left, so the water balance is the stage's summation equation.
- **Water** is never in the hydrocarbon liquid. It condenses only in the overhead drum, as free water.
- **Duties** are evaluated from the converged state; they are not unknowns.

The solve is a damped Newton from a bubble-point initialisation. It reports `converged` rather than raising: a set of specs with no solution comes back `converged=False`. Too little overflash for the heat a pumparound removes is one such set.

(refinery-furnace)=
### The furnace

With a `Furnace` in the params, the column's feed is the furnace *inlet*: the crude as the preheat train delivers it. The coil outlet temperature becomes one more unknown, solved with the column:

- The absorbed duty is the enthalpy rise of the crude from inlet to coil outlet, each evaluated by a flash. The fired duty is the absorbed duty over `efficiency`.
- The coil outlet pressure defaults to the feed stage's.
- The extra freedom is usually closed by an `overflash`, which is how an operator runs the heater. Solving the furnace in front of the column instead would need the outlet temperature guessed and iterated by hand.

---

(refinery-products)=
## Products

`product_properties(products, thermo, feed)` returns, for each hydrocarbon product:

- its rates: `mole`, `mass`, `volume` and `bpd`;
- `yield_volume` and `yield_mass` against the crude;
- `sg`, `api` and `mw`;
- TBP points at 5, 10, 50, 90 and 95 % (`tbp_at(pct)`).

`products.gaps(properties, order)` gives the 5--95 gap between neighbouring cuts: `TBP5(heavier) - TBP95(lighter)`. A positive gap is a clean separation; a negative one is an overlap.

The TBP curves are built from the pseudo-components a product contains, so they are no finer than the cuts. A gap of a few kelvin is within that resolution. ASTM D86 conversion is not done; the gap is defined on TBP.

---

(refinery-crude-unit)=
## The crude unit

`CrudeUnit` puts characterisation, thermo, furnace, column and product properties together:

```python
import difflow_refinery as dr

unit = dr.CrudeUnit(assay, params)     # a default Furnace is added if params has none
res = unit.solve(95_000, T=273.15 + 240, P=6e5)   # bbl/d at the furnace inlet
print(res.table())
res.gaps()
```

On the test crude, a 30-stage column with three side strippers, two pumparounds and a 5 % overflash gives:

- a coil outlet of about 315 °C and about 52 MW fired;
- naphtha, kerosene, diesel, AGO and residue at 20, 11, 17, 5 and 47 vol %;
- API gravities from 64.5 down to 18.7.

`solve` takes `assay=` (same light ends and cut points) and `params=` (same layout), so derivatives with respect to the assay and the specs are a `jax.grad` of a function that calls it:

```python
import jax

def residue_api(sg):
    a = dr.Assay([0, 30, 70, 100], [320.0, 480.0, 640.0, 900.0], sg=sg)
    return unit.solve(1.0, T=480.0, P=4e5, basis="mole", assay=a).properties["residue"].api

jax.grad(residue_api)(0.85)
```

---

(refinery-unit-operations)=
## Unit operations

### CrudeDistillationUnit

The crude unit as a flowsheet operation. It is built from one `CrudeDistillationUnitParams` (`assay`, `column`, `cut_points`, `method`), called with the crude stream at the furnace inlet, and returns the product streams in `outlet_names` order:

1. the distillate;
2. each side product, in the order the column declares them;
3. `"residue"`;
4. `"water"`;
5. with a partial condenser, `"offgas"`.

```python
from difflow import Flowsheet
from difflow.flowsheet import Unit

cdu = dr.CrudeDistillationUnit(dr.CrudeDistillationUnitParams(assay=assay, column=params))
feed = cdu.feed(95_000, T=513.15, P=6e5)          # bbl/d; also basis="mass"/"mole"/"volume"

fs = Flowsheet(list(cdu.unit.thermo.names) + ["water"])
fs.add_feed("crude", feed)
fs.add_unit(Unit("cdu", cdu, ["crude"], list(cdu.outlet_names)))
streams = fs.solve()
cdu.last_result.table()                           # the full result of the last call
```

- **Inlet:** the inlet needs a flow for every component the assay characterises into; `cdu.feed(...)` makes one.
- **Full result:** `cdu.solve(feed)` returns the full `CrudeUnitResult` (column profiles, duties, product properties) rather than the streams.
- **Serialisation:** the assay, the column params and every nested spec, side product, pumparound and furnace are plain dataclasses, so the unit writes to and reads back from JSON with `difflow.serialize`.

---

(refinery-blending)=
## Product blending

`difflow_refinery` holds refinery models. Its first one is the **product blending pool**. It mixes component streams into finished products (gasoline, jet, ULSD, fuel oil), computes the properties that specs are written on, and reports a signed margin per spec. It uses the nonlinear blending rules refiners use, and it is differentiable in the recipe and in every component property.

```python
from difflow_refinery import BlendComponent, BlendPool

reformate = BlendComponent.from_properties(
    "reformate", SG=0.80, RON=98.0, MON=88.0, RVP_psi=3.5, S_ppm=1.0,
    olefins_vol=1.0, aromatics_vol=65.0)
# ... fcc, alkylate, butane likewise

pool = BlendPool("gasoline")                 # default specs: RON, MON, RVP, S
res = pool([reformate, fcc, alkylate, butane], recipe=[0.35, 0.35, 0.25, 0.05])
res.properties["MON"], res.margins["MON >= 82"]

pool.linear_blend_error(components, recipe)  # nonlinear minus linear-by-volume
pool.backoff(components, recipe, exact=("RVP_psi", "S_ppm"))
pool.spec_violations(components, recipe, temperature=0.05)   # smooth max(-m, 0)
pool.as_block(components)                    # a difflow.planning.Block
```

Like `difflow.planning`, this is a library rather than a set of GUI palette operations. It registers no `difflow.plugins` entry point. A pool is called with a recipe and returns properties and margins, which is not the stream-in/stream-out shape a palette unit has.

Example: `examples/33_refinery_gasoline_blending.ipynb`. Tests: `tests/refinery/test_blending.py`.

### Components: property mode and stream mode

A `BlendComponent` is built one of two ways:

- **`from_properties(name, SG=..., RON=..., ...)`**: measured or unit-reported properties only. This is enough for every *blended* property.
- **`from_stream(name, stream, characterization, **overrides)`**: a difflow stream of pseudocomponent molar flows on a shared `BlendCharacterization`. The composition gives `SG`, sulfur, nitrogen, PNA and a Raoult RVP. Overrides (a reformer's reported RON, say) take precedence. This mode adds:
  - the product **stream**, with an exact mass and volume balance;
  - the properties only composition can give: distillation and cetane index;
  - the Raoult RVP of the blend itself.

One pool takes one mode. Mixing the two raises an error rather than producing a product stream that is missing some components' mass.

**Volume basis.** Volumes are ideal-mixing volumes at 15 °C from `SG` (`rho = SG * 999.10 kg/m^3`). The product volume is the sum of the component volumes, and the product `SG` is the volume average. Both are tested to round-off against the product stream's own composition.

Recipes can be given as `basis="volume_fraction"` (the default), `"volume_flow"`, or `"split"`. A split is the fraction of each component stream's available volume sent to the pool, which is the natural lever when the pool sits in a flowsheet.

### Blending rules

| Property | Key | Rule (default first) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| RON, MON | `RON`, `MON` | Ethyl RT-70 interaction model; or linear by volume | Healy, Maassen & Peterson (1959), Ethyl report RT-70 |
| RVP | `RVP_psi` | RVP^1.25 index by volume; Raoult on the pseudocomponents; or linear | Gary, Handwerk & Kaiser, product blending chapter |
| Sulfur, nitrogen, CCR | `S_ppm`, `N_ppm`, `CCR_wt` | by mass | - |
| Aromatics, olefins, benzene, PNA, smoke point | `*_vol`, `smoke_mm` | by volume | - |
| Flash point | `flash_C` | Hu-Burns index, `log10 BI = -6.1188 + 2414/(T - 42.6)` (K), by volume | Hu & Burns (1970); identical to Wickey-Chittenden in °F |
| Cloud, pour point | `cloud_C`, `pour_C` | `BI = T^n` (K), n = 1/0.05 and 1/0.08 | Hu & Burns (1970) |
| Freeze point, CFPP | `freeze_C`, `CFPP_C` | `BI = T^n`, cloud-type and pour-type exponents | approximation, override with `rules={"freeze_C_exponent": ...}` |
| Viscosity | `viscosity_cSt` | Refutas VBN `14.534 ln ln(nu + 0.8) + 10.975`, by mass | Refutas, as given in Maples (2000) |
| Distillation | `E70_tbp`, `E100_tbp`, `T{10,50,90,95}_d86_C` | from the blend's composition: smoothed TBP, then Riazi-Daubert TBP->D86 | Riazi & Daubert (1986) |
| Cetane index | `cetane_index` | ASTM D4737 (default) or D976 on the blend's density and D86 points; computed, never blended | ASTM D4737, D976 |

Choose rules per property with `BlendPool(rules={"octane": "volume", "RVP_psi": "raoult", "cetane": "d976"})`.

The RT-70 corrections are all *spreads*: covariances and variances across the components of sensitivity, olefins and aromatics. The model therefore reduces exactly to the linear blend when the components agree. The coefficients are the published 75-blend fit (`a1 = 0.03224`, `a2 = 0.00101`, `a3 = 0`, `b1 = 0.04450`, `b2 = 0.00081`, `b3 = -0.0645`, the last on the squared aromatic spread / 1e4), as restated in the gasoline-blending literature. They live in `EthylRT70` and can be refitted. On a reformate/FCC pool the MON correction is several octane numbers, so check them against your own blend data.

The distillation points are on a TBP curve made differentiable by spreading each pseudocomponent with a logistic of `distillation_width` (default 5 K). Each point is then converted to D86 with the Riazi-Daubert correlation, because specs are written on D86. `E70`/`E100` stay on the TBP basis, and the key says so.

### Specs and margins

`BlendSpec(property, op, limit, scale=1.0)`. The margin is `value - limit` for `>=` and `limit - value` for `<=`, divided by `scale`, so **positive means on spec**. `PRODUCT_SPECS` holds illustrative defaults for each product: US regular summer gasoline, Jet A, ULSD S15, and VLSFO RMG 380. Pass your own specs for anything real.

- `spec_margins(components, recipe)` returns the margin vector, smooth in everything. With `weighted=True` it returns `V * margin` instead. A property is intensive, so it is 0/0 at an empty pool. The weighted form is the same constraint wherever `V > 0`, stays finite at zero, and is the form an LP's blending rows take. Use it as the constraint for an optimizer over volume flows.
- `spec_violations(..., temperature=t)` returns `max(-margin, 0)`, or its softplus `t * logaddexp(-margin/t, 0)`. The smooth form is within `t ln 2` of the kink and its derivative at an active spec is exactly `-1/2`. The branchless `max(u,0) + log1p(exp(-|u|))` has the same value and a derivative of zero there; see the CVaR note in `difflow.stochastic`.

### Linear blend error and back-off

`linear_properties` is the planning-LP view: every property linear by volume. `linear_blend_error` is nonlinear minus that view, and it is what a planner's back-off is meant to cover. Pass `exact=("RVP_psi", "S_ppm")` for properties the LP already models with the pool's own rule (the RVP index, sulfur by mass). Their error is then zero. `backoff` turns the error into a per-spec tightening, `max(linear margin - nonlinear margin, 0)`.

The example measures what this means for a gasoline LP:

- without back-off, the LP promises about 50% more margin than any feasible plan, and its recipe is about two MON numbers off spec;
- the back-off depends on the recipe, so one pass is not enough; successive back-off takes about a dozen passes to settle;
- on that pool the converged plan coincides with the best local optimum of the nonlinear problem, but a single-start NLP stops at a worse one. Blending is nonconvex, so neither tool is safe alone.

### Planning hook

`pool.as_block(components)` returns a `difflow.planning.Block`. Its levers are the component volume flows (`<name>_V`), bounded by availability in stream mode. Its outputs are the product `volume`, the spec properties, and `margin:<spec>` for every spec. `jax.jacobian` of the block is the delta-vector set: the volume row is the volume balance, all ones, and the property rows are the blend's sensitivities at the linearisation point.

### Blend characterization

`BlendCharacterization(names, Tb, SG, MW=, Tc=, Pc=, omega=, qualities=)` is the pseudocomponent grid. Molecular weight and critical constants come from Riazi-Daubert (1980), the acentric factor from Edmister, and vapor pressure from Lee-Kesler. Any of them can be overridden per pseudocomponent by passing a vector with NaN where the correlation should be used. That is how a defined component such as n-butane takes its own constants. `qualities` holds the per-pseudocomponent composition vectors (`S_ppm`, `aromatics_vol`, ...), each averaged on its own basis.

This is the minimum a blend pool needs to compute properties from composition. It is not an assay model: there is no TBP fitting and no heavy-end extrapolation. The CDU/VDU work is where those belong.

### Not in scope

- Tank inventory and multi-period scheduling. The pool is steady state, per period.
- Crude blending ahead of the CDU (assay mixing).
- A straight-run octane correlation from PNA. Octane is unit-reported or measured.

(refinery-limitations)=
## Limitations

- **Atmospheric column only.** The vacuum column, preflash drum and preheat train are not modelled; the inlet is the preheat train's outlet.
- **Thermodynamics:** Raoult's law and ideal-gas-path enthalpies. This is the usual model for an atmospheric column at one or two bar; it is not a cubic equation of state.
- **Equilibrium stages.** There are no tray efficiencies or hydraulics.
- **Boiling ranges are TBP, not ASTM D86.**
- **Validation:** checked against its own balances and against finite differences, not yet against a commercial simulator's crude case.
